Hi there, this is my new Flutter project.The code for this app has been written in Android Studio with Dart Programming Language.

### This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):


```Dart
custom_fade_animation:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/Jaydip04/custom_fade_animation.git
    ref: master
```

### Easy to use


```dart
FadeTransitionExample(duration: duration, curve: curve);
```


### Code example in main.dart

```dart
FadeTransitionExample(duration: Duration(seconds: 2), curve: Curves.easeInOutBack)
```
